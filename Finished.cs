/*

Layer Class:

Represents a single layer of a neural network.
It has variables for the number of input and output nodes, weight and bias arrays, cost gradients, weight velocities, and an activation function.
The constructor initializes the layer with the specified number of input and output nodes, and it initializes the weights randomly.
CalculateOutputs method computes the activations of the output nodes based on input values, weights, and biases, and applies the activation function.
ApplyGradients method updates weights and biases during training using the gradient descent algorithm.
CalculateOutputLayerNodeValues computes node values for the output layer based on cost derivatives.
CalculateHiddenLayerNodeValues computes node values for hidden layers based on the next layer's node values.
UpdateGradients method updates gradients during training.
There are other helper methods for weight management and activation function.

NeuralNetwork Class:

Represents the entire neural network, consisting of multiple layers.
The constructor initializes the network with the specified layer sizes and creates individual layers.
CalculateOutputs method computes the final output layer by looping through each layer.
Classify method returns the index of the output node with the highest confidence, useful for classification tasks.
Learn method updates the gradients for a batch of training data, applies gradient descent, and clears gradients.
Various helper methods like UpdateAllGradients, ApplyGradients, ClearAllGradients, and IndexOfMaxValue.
Customizable  aspects of training, including learning rate, regularization, and momentum.
To use this neural network framework, you would create an instance of the NeuralNetwork class, provide training data, and continue calling the Learn method to train the network. The trained network can then be used for making predictions or classifications.

The goal is to to use this for Spacecraft Trajectory Prediction and Celestial Body Classification

But after a couple months of tutorials, research and good old fashioned hard work here we are! My first Neural Network. 
Now to test it.
